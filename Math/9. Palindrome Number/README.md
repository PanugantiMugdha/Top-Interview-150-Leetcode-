Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
```text
x = 121
```
**Output:** True

## Time Complexity

**O(n)**  
Where `n` is the number of digits in the integer `x`.  
Each digit is processed once to reverse the number.

## Space Complexity

**O(1)**  
Only a few integer variables are used; no extra space is required.
